Description: Compute trimmed mean estimates of simulated samples from Normal distribution,
    with the grounding true mean (mu), grounding true standard deviation (sigma)
    trim ratio (tr), sample size (n) and number of simulations (N) given.  
    Depending on the need of analysis, it can generate tabularized statistical 
    summaries of the trimmed mean estimates, and draw various plots.
